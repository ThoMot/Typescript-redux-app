## Example project for setting up Redux with Typescript and React.

The purpose of this repo is to provide an example of how a redux reducer can be set up with Typescript using hooks. 

No actions are currently implemented in this version of the repo as it was intended as a simple example project to get people started with redux reducers. More might be added to this repo at a later time.
